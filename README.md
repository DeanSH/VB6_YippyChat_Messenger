# VB6_YippyChat_Messenger
YippyChat Messenger was a Windows-based application made using VB6 that very much replicated Yahoo Messenger after they closed chat rooms in 2012, but had secure data protocol encryption and newer features than Yahoo such as Screen sharing and chat room Tattoo's. I owned and operated YippyChat successfully for 2 years before decided to close it down, it was comprised of multiple server-side application to fully function, and supported such features as Registration, Login, preferences, ignores, private messaging, skins, profile pictures, friends list, custom status messages, chat rooms with voice channels, smileys, webcams, voice calling, file transfers and much more!
